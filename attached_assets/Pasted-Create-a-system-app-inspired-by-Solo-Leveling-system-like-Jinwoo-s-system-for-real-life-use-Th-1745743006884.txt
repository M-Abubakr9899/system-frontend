Create a system app inspired by Solo Leveling system (like Jinwoo's system) for real life use.

The system should include:

Tasks Section

Exercises Section

Points System (win points by completing tasks)

Skills Section (only real-life skills, no anime-based ones).

Customize and improve it by:

Change the overall theme color to Red.

I should be able to manually create and modify Available Tasks, but do not remove the default system tasks.

When I click the Complete button on a task, the task section should become dull to show it’s completed.

Remove fantasy skills like "Mana Control" and "Shadow Extraction".

Add real-life skills: Intelligence and Stamina.

Include these default daily tasks:

Complete College Work (3 Hours)

Learn Arabic, Quran (1 Hour)

Write one Hades Everyday

Typing Speed to 50 WPM (30 Min)

Facebook Management Course (1 Hour)

Python (1 Hour)

Add a Rules Section and create a button to manually add new rules.

Add a Skills Section with a button to manually add or remove skills.

Make the system more flexible so that after all tasks are completed, the app still works properly (no blank screens).

Remove the Custom Tasks section and replace it with a Reset System button.

Reset Button must:

Reset all player stats and hunter status to zero.

Reset daily task completions.

Do NOT reset skills or rules or daily tasks list.

Fix problems:

Reset button should work fully as mentioned above.

Completed tasks should turn dull after clicking.

Add the following default Rules inside Rules Section:

Follow Time Table

No Songs

No Animes

No Reels

Sunnah and Time Sleeping (with Blanket)

No staying up unnecessarily

Reduce the frequency of bad habits

No Junk or Fast Food

Chew food properly

Less talk, with low voice pitch

Create a Side Navigation Panel to move between these tabs:

Dashboard

Time Table

Rules

Dashboard should contain:

Hunter Status

Skills

Daily Tasks

Move the Rules Section OUT of the Dashboard and into a separate tab in the side panel.

When I click on Timetable, do not remove the Side Panel. The Side Panel should always stay visible and functional.

Now Make the UI more better like add some glowing lights in background, fix the text arrangements and other small details , use the image that i link to get some more information.

Create a progress bar with visuals.
Build the same modern "Solo Leveling System" UI.
Use TailwindCSS or modern React styling.

Include Dashboard, Timetable, Rules pages.

Add Hunter Status, Skills, Daily Tasks, etc.

Add red theme and proper buttons, sidebars, animations.

Make the task completion UI dull when clicked ✅.
